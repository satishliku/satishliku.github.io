<h3>and what you should do about it.</h3>
<p>For as long as human beings have used currency to trade goods and services, counterfeiters have found one way or the other to replicate notes with cheaper and inferior duplicates, and profit from the same. While federal banking institutions across the world keep coming up with more sophisticated security features that are harder to duplicate, counterfeiters have always managed to stay one step ahead. The only way to beat them is to take a hard look at our existing fake note detectors.</p>

<h4>Counterfeit Pens</h4>
<p>Designed specifically for retail stores, counterfeit pens allow lay persons to easily identify fake notes. These pens contain a special ink (typically iodine) that reacts with starch, which is the primary component of fake notes. If the note is fake, the pen will leave a brown or black mark behind. If genuine, the mark is amber or clear.</p>
<p>Among all the fake note detectors out there, counterfeit pens are the least reliable. Though simple to use, the technology can be easily overcome by even amateur counterfeiters. For example, counterfeiters can take a smaller denomination note and bleach it with a larger denomination, thereby passing the iodine test.</p>

<h4>UV Detectors</h4>
<p>One of the most common methods for fake note detection is the UV detection technique. Genuine notes contain certain security features which are visible only under UV light. When a retailor suspects a counterfeit note, they can simply place it under the UV light and look for these security features. If not present, then the note is definitely a counterfeit. </p>
<p>UV detectors are easily affordable by most business owners. However, their biggest downside is that the retailor must still know all the security features of the notes to be a 100% certain of the results. As new notes get introduced in the market, this is not the most feasible option. Moreover, certain security features can be replicated counterfeiters, thereby fooling retailors.</p>

<p> Testing</p>
<h5>Automatic Image Detectors</h5>
<p>With automatic image detection technology, retailors can know with certainty whether or not a note is counterfeit. Image detection software identifies both the dimensions and security features of the note and is therefore, completely fool-proof and easy to operate.</p>
<p>However, this technology is bulky, doesn’t work for damaged or soiled notes, and its biggest disadvantage is that it can be very expensive for a typical retailor. Moreover, as the security features of notes get upgraded by federal government, these detectors also need a software upgrade frequently. This, in turn, is not a cost-effective solution.</p>

	<p>M-Code detection is Kores Empower’s new state-of-the-art technology that has revolutionized fake note detection. This innovative technology authenticates the note at a molecular level and offers unmatched precision. As the testing happens at the molecular level, the front end personnel need not know the security features of the note. The technology needs no upgrade even as the security features of the notes change. And the best part, the notes can be inked, soiled or even torn – M-Code detection allows authentication of these notes with the same precision.</p>
	<p>A perfects balance between reliability and M-Code detection is just what any business needs to safeguard themselves from counterfeiters.</p>
